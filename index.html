            <h2>Course Learning Reflections</h2>
            <p>Each team member will provide the following in separate pages. Each student will logically divide sections and sub-sections as per their understanding:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What are the kinds of problems we see in nature? (iteration, recursion, backtracking)</li>
                <li>What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain different classes of problems and orders of growth.</li>
                <li>Key takeaways from different design principles from Chapter 2.</li>
                <li>The hierarchical data and how different tree data structures solve and optimize over problem scenarios (tree, BST, AVL, 2-3, red-black, heap, trie).</li>
                <li>The need for array query algorithms and their implications. Applications and principles need discussion.</li>
                <li>Differentiate between tree and graph traversals, their applications, and real-world connection.</li>
                <li>Deliberate on sorting and searching algorithms, techniques, and real-world connections.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="questions">
            <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>How do you determine the most efficient approach when solving a complex problem?</li>
                <li>What criteria do you use to evaluate the effectiveness of a solution?</li>
                <li>How can you adapt an existing solution to address new challenges?</li>
                <li>What strategies do you use to identify patterns in datasets or problems?</li>
                <li>How do you decide when to prioritize simplicity over optimization?</li>
                <li>Reflect on breaking down problems into smaller components to approach them effectively.</li>
                <li>Reflect on trade-offs in different approaches to solve a problem.</li>
                <li>How do you identify and address potential weaknesses in a proposed solution?</li>
                <li>How can applying knowledge in one context help in solving a different problem?</li>
                <li>How do you decide when to innovate versus rely on tested solutions?</li>
