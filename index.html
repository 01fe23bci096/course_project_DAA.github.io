            <h2>Course Learning Reflections</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What are the kinds of problems we see in nature?</strong><br>
                    Problems such as finding optimal paths, predicting outcomes (recursion), and solving puzzles (backtracking).
                </li>
                <li><strong>What is space and time efficiency?</strong><br>
                    Space efficiency refers to minimizing memory usage, while time efficiency measures how quickly an algorithm runs. Both are crucial in real-time systems.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Key takeaways from Chapter 2:</strong><br>
                    Focus on modularity, simplicity, and understanding trade-offs between performance and implementation complexity.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Hierarchical data and trees:</strong><br>
                    Structures like AVL and Red-Black trees balance data, enabling faster search, insert, and delete operations.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Array query algorithms:</strong><br>
                    Algorithms like binary search enable faster query responses in sorted arrays, essential for large databases.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Tree vs. graph traversals:</strong><br>
                    Trees are hierarchical and graphs handle complex networks, e.g., DFS in graphs for maze solving.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Sorting and searching algorithms:</strong><br>
                    Techniques like Merge Sort ensure stable sorting, and their applications span e-commerce and analytics.
